# Vigenere Cypher solver
 
This is a basic JS cypher solver for the Vignere Cypher.

#### Features:
* Finds probable key length and then most likely key codes. Usually sovles in it less than a second.
* If the previous fails, it will brute force solve it matching words in the english language. This is slow.

Pull requests appreciated. This was made for a college class and is not an optimal codebase.
